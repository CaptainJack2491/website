JAYRUP NAKAWALA
--------------------------------------------------
Infrastructure & AI Safety–Focused CS Undergraduate \
University of East London

I build and study systems where models act, decide,
and sometimes misbehave.

Current focus:

- Agentic LLM behaviour and deceptive alignment
- AI safety evaluation via controlled environments
- Self-hosted, reproducible infrastructure
- Compact and efficient model representations

I prefer tools that run locally, logs that can be
inspected, and experiments that fail loudly.
