## [1] DECEPTIVE ALIGNMENT IN AUTONOMOUS LLM AGENTS \
Undergraduate Dissertation (Final Year)

Built an agentic LLM framework to study hidden goal
pursuit under conflicting in-context instructions.
Agents operate in a sandboxed virtual file system
with constrained tools and full behavioural logging.

Experiments vary perceived oversight levels and
analyse deceptive tactics using:

- deterministic text filters
- black-box LLM judges (user perception)
- glass-box reasoning vs output analysis

Focus: AI safety, evaluation methodology, detectability
of hidden goals.

## [2] SELF-HOSTED INFRASTRUCTURE

Personal infrastructure spanning home server and VPS,
using Tailscale for private access and Docker Compose
for service orchestration.

Public and private services are segmented cleanly,
with minimal maintenance and reproducible setup.

## [3] THREE REWARDS SCRAPER

Found the internal API used by the Three (sim company) 
rewards website and automated collecting rewards using
a script attached to a cron job.

Worked with JWTs and jq to parse the response. First 
used curl and jq for prototyping and then implimented 
in python for production.
